## Project Write-up: Product Landing Page 

 

Project Overview: The aim of this project is to create a webpage that promotes a specific product. We'll be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it. The webpage will have an attractive design and provide information about the product, its features, and pricing. We want to encourage users to buy the product or learn more about it by including a button that stands out and prompts them to take action. 

  

Functional Requirements: 

  

Product Information: 

  

Show important details about the product, like its name, description, and key features. 

  

Include high-quality images or videos that showcase the product. 

  

Responsive Design: 

  

Make sure the webpage adjusts well to different screen sizes and devices. 

  

The layout and design should look good and work properly on both computers and mobile devices. 

  

Call-to-Action: 

  

Put a noticeable button that prompts users to do something specific, like making a purchase or signing up for more information. 

  

The button should be placed strategically and stand out visually to catch users' attention. 

  

Navigation: 

  

Include a menu or links that let users explore different parts of the webpage, such as product features, pricing, testimonials, or a contact form. 

  

Interactive Elements: 

  

Add interactive features, like image sliders, tooltips, or animations, to make the webpage more interesting and engaging for users.
